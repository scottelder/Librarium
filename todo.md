# Primary Features

## Catalogs

### These would be types of collections -- books, movies, games or novels, nonfiction, technical or categories your heart desires!

#### Mixed media should also be an option.

## Shelves

### A subset of a specific catalog, these are (meta)physical shelves where you store specific works. 

#### Includes a name and description of the shelf.

## Works

### The individual works in the library.

#### It should be possible for a given work to belong to multiple catalogs.
#### Some sort of check-out functionality (loan-out) including to whom (esp if they're also a user) and when.
#### Goodreads API tie-in + other APIs if possible for rating and review data.
#### Read/watched/played v. unread/unwatched/unplayed
#### Reviewable + session data -- how was setup for this game? did you need to do anything special to explain it? do you have any thoughts you'd like to share?

## Data Visualization

### Use d3 or some other JS data visualization tool to showcase library to users
